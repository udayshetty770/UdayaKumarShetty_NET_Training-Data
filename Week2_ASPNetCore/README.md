# Week 2: ASP.NET Core + Entity Framework + Web API Development

## Objective
Build upon C# fundamentals to develop scalable, data-driven web applications using ASP.NET Core.  
Gain hands-on experience with Entity Framework Core, RESTful API creation, and integration with SQL Server.  
Strengthen practical understanding through daily coding exercises and documentation.

**Mini Exercise:**  
Add a SQL Server database to the Student API and perform create, read, update, and delete operations using EF Core.

---

### [Day 4 (19-10-2025): Model Validation and Exception Handling](https://github.com/udayshetty770/UdayaKumarShetty_NET_Training-Data/tree/main/Week2_ASPNetCore/Day-4%20(19-10-2025))
- Data annotations for model validation  
- Custom validation attributes  
- Handling exceptions globally with middleware  
- Returning standardized API responses  

**Mini Exercise:**  
Implement custom validation for student input and create a global error handler.

---

### [Day 5 (20-10-2025): API Documentation using Swagger](https://github.com/udayshetty770/UdayaKumarShetty_NET_Training-Data/tree/main/Week2_ASPNetCore/Day-5%20(20-10-2025))
- Integrating Swagger UI (Swashbuckle)  
- Customizing API documentation and routes  
- Understanding OpenAPI specification  

**Mini Exercise:**  
Add and configure Swagger UI for automatic documentation of all endpoints.

---

### [Day 6 (21-10-2025): Advanced API Features](https://github.com/udayshetty770/UdayaKumarShetty_NET_Training-Data/tree/main/Week2_ASPNetCore/Day-6%20(21-10-2025))
- Versioning APIs  
- Asynchronous programming with async/await  
- Consuming APIs using HttpClient  
- Securing endpoints (intro to authentication and authorization)  

**Mini Exercise:**  
Add asynchronous endpoints and practice consuming the API using a console client.

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code – Development environment  
- SQL Server / SSMS – Database integration  
- Postman – API testing  
- Swagger (Swashbuckle) – API documentation  
- Git and GitHub – Version control  

---

## Daily Practice
Continue solving one programming logic or DSA problem daily on:
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)

Focus on problems related to hashmaps, linked lists, recursion, and OOP-based logic building.

---

## Deliverables
