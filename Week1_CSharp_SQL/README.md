# Week 1: C# Fundamentals + SQL Basics + Logic Practice

## Objective
Establish a solid foundation in C# programming, understand SQL and RDBMS concepts, and begin daily problem-solving practice to build strong logical thinking.

## Topics Covered

### [Day 1 (09-10-2025): C# and Object-Oriented Programming Basics](https://github.com/udayshetty770/UdayaKumarShetty_NET_Training-Data/tree/main/Week1_CSharp_SQL/Day-1%20(%2009-10-2025%20))
- CLR, JIT, and Garbage Collector  
- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while)  
- Methods (parameters, optional, and output)  
- Classes, structs, interfaces, and enums  
- Object-Oriented Programming principles: inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism  
- Exception handling (try, catch, finally)  

**Mini Exercise:**  
Create a simple console application such as a Student Grade Calculator demonstrating the use of classes and interfaces.

- Handling runtime errors using try-catch-finally  
- Working with custom exceptions  
- File input/output operations in C#  
- Reading and writing text files  

**Mini Exercise:**  
Build a file-based student record manager that reads and writes student data from a text file.

### [Day 5 (13-10-2025): Advanced C# Concepts](https://github.com/udayshetty770/UdayaKumarShetty_NET_Training-Data/tree/main/Week1_CSharp_SQL/Day-5%20(%2013-10-2025%20))
- Delegates and Events  
- Anonymous methods and Lambda expressions  
- Generics in C#  
- Namespaces and Assemblies  

**Mini Exercise:**  
Create a small project demonstrating delegates and events for a notification system.

### [Day 6 (14-10-2025): Logic Building and Problem Solving](https://github.com/udayshetty770/UdayaKumarShetty_NET_Training-Data/tree/main/Week1_CSharp_SQL/Day-6%20(%2014-10-2025%20))
- Building logic using loops and arrays  
- Recursion and simple algorithm design  
- Debugging and tracing logic errors  
- Practicing DSA basics with C#  

**Mini Exercise:**  
Solve basic DSA problems (like palindrome, factorial, Fibonacci, sorting) in C# console apps.

### [Day 7 (15-10-2025): Week Summary and Mini Project](https://github.com/udayshetty770/UdayaKumarShetty_NET_Training-Data/tree/main/Week1_CSharp_SQL/Day-7%20(%2015-10-2025%20)%20-%20With%20Mini%20Project)
- Integrating all learned concepts  
- Working with multi-file projects in C#  
- SQL integration with C# applications  
- Preparing for Week 2 (ASP.NET Core)  

**Mini Project:**  
Build a **Student Information Console Application** that interacts with an SQL database for CRUD operations.

---

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio (for C# Console Applications)  
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- Git and GitHub for version control  

---

## Daily Practice
Solve one easy-to-medium data structure and algorithm problem daily on:
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org)  
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)

Focus on problems related to arrays, strings, loops, recursion, and trees.

---

## Deliverables
- C# console program exercises  
- SQL practice scripts  
- Daily DSA problem tracker (text or Excel format)
