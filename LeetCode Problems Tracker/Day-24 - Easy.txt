Number of 1 Bits

Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Example 2:

Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

Example 3:

Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.

 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1

public class Solution{   public int HammingWeight(int n)
        {
            int sum = 0;
            bool flag = false;

            if (n < 0)
            {
                flag = true;
                n = n - int.MinValue;
            }

            while (n > 0)
            {
                int k = n % 2;
                sum += k;
                n /= 2;
            }

            return flag ? sum + 1 : sum;
        }
    }
