# Week 1: C# Fundamentals + SQL Basics + Logic Practice

## Objective
Establish a solid foundation in C# programming, understand SQL and RDBMS concepts, and begin daily problem-solving practice to build strong logical thinking.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. C# and Object-Oriented Programming Basics (3 Days)
- CLR, JIT, and Garbage Collector  
- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Methods (parameters, optional, and output)  
- Classes, structs, interfaces, and enums  
- Object-Oriented Programming principles: inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism  
- Exception handling (`try`, `catch`, `finally`)  

**Mini Exercise:**  
Create a simple console application, such as a Student Grade Calculator, demonstrating the use of classes and interfaces.

---

### 2. Collections and LINQ (1 Day)
- Arrays, Lists, and Dictionaries  
- Iteration using `foreach`  
- LINQ basics (`Select`, `Where`)  
- Lambda expressions  

**Mini Exercise:**  
Write a LINQ query to filter and display student records based on specific conditions.

---

### 3. SQL and RDBMS Concepts (1 Day)
- Fundamentals of RDBMS: tables, keys, and normalization (1NF, 2NF)  
- SQL operations: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`  
- Understanding `JOINS`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`  
- Creating tables and stored procedures using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

**Mini Exercise:**  
Design a simple table and perform basic SQL queries for inserting, updating, and retrieving records.

---

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio (for C# Console Applications)  
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- Git and GitHub for version control  

---

## Daily Practice
Solve one easy-to-medium data structure and algorithm problem daily on:
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org)  
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)

Focus on problems related to arrays, strings, loops, recursion, and trees.

---

## Deliverables
- C# console program exercises  
- SQL practice scripts  
- Daily DSA problem tracker (text or Excel format)
